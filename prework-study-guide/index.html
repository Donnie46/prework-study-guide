          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are making the element bigger.</li>
          <li>There are 3 ways to style a webpage using CSS: Inline CSS, Internal CSS Style Sheet, and the most common way is External CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>A declaration contains 2 important components, the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>If we want to apply a rule to all elements on the page, we insert a "*" symbol.</li>
          <li>CSS determines the styles of a webpage in order to make a website visually appealing. CSS can also make a website simpler to use with a polished design and consistent organization.</li>
